Additional description about the Website and its features.

## Built With

- HTML 5
- CSS3
- CSS-Grid
- CSS-Flex
- Bootstrap
- C#

## Steps Taken

I used the Mobile first approach, made sure i added the viewport at the start of the page to make sure it takes up all devices width.
Created divs and sections that are visible in the mobile section.
Added bootstrap classes to sections that i needed to respond flawlessly in both desktop and mobile devices.
I added all the content and images needed for the project.
I also created cards for speakers and the program main.
I called the main showcase through css and used the z-index to create an overlay of the showcase font, headings and paragraphs.
I used grid to align and arrange the main program cards.
I also used grid to create the speakers cards and used boostrap to make the responsive.
I used flex for the partners logos and the sections are all responsive.
I used grid to align content for the large screen together with a media query.
